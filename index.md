## About me

Hi, my name’s Henrique! I’m a developer focused on open-source projects for the web. I love to learn and I have no fear to grab and try out new technologies. Currently, I’m based in Lisbon and enrolled in a degree in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico. Also, I am mainly working with JavaScript and Go right now.

## Projects

Currently, I'm primarily working on two different projects and maintaining my open-source projects.

+ **Protocol Labs, Open Source Scholarship** (Nov 2017 - Now) - mainly working as a open-source contributor on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) project with technologies such as React, Electron and Node.js. Among my duties, I have to interact with the community, fix bugs, improve the users’ experience.
+ **Upframe, Full Stack Developer** (Sep 2016 - Now) - Upframe connects students and recent graduates to the entrepreneurial scene, empowering them to build their own projects and startups.

Other projects I've worked on:

+ File Manager
+ Caddy Plugins

Past Experience:

+ **Pplware, Content Writer** (June 2013 - Sep 2016) - Pplware is the biggest Portuguese blog about technology,
which is divided into some smaller projects. I worked on Pplware itself and on Pplware Kids. I had to write new
articles about tech news, curiosities, tutorials and much more.
