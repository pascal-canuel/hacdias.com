## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am <span class='glitch b' data-text='Henrique Dias'>Henrique Dias</span> and I study Computer
Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, Portugal while working at the most fascinating
open-source projects, just like <a target='_blank' href='https://ipfs.io'>IPFS</a>. Want to know a bit
more about me and maybe why's my handle "hacdias"? [You're in the right track!][0]
