Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Currently, I am studying Information Systems and Computer Engineering
at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico][1] in Lisbon. I started programming at a very young age, but I
always wanted to know more than that because programming, despites being in the base
of computer software, doesn't really tell you how everything works together.

    <span class='b'>The (un)story of my handle:</span> most likely you've already noticed that
    my handle, @hacdias, reminds of the word 'hack'. Although, I can assure you they have
    nothing to do with each other. It was a mere coincidence between the first letters of my
    first name and middle names - 'hac' - and last name - 'dias' - that I happen to enjoy.

In **2013**, I started writing articles to [Pplware][2], which is a Portuguese project
that delivers the most recent news about technology to the Portuguese speaking community.
It has a blog, a forum, a "sell your used stuff" kind of platform and many discussion groups.

In late **2016**, I joined a project called [Upframe][3] as a Full Stack Developer in which
I had the opportunity to talk and to work with people from different educational backgrounds
(design, economics...). We aim to boost the growth of the Portuguese technology panorama.

In late **2017**, I was offered an Open Source Scholarship at [Protocol Labs][4], which is responsible for [IPFS][5] - the InterPlanetary File System, a decentralized and peer-to-peer protocol. On this project, my focus relies mostly on IPFS Desktop and WebUI which are graphical interfaces to manage a node.

I defend the transparency and openness when creating software so you can say I am an
Open Source advocate. You can check out [my GitHub profile][6] if you want to know
more about what I'm doing right now. If you want to find me in any other social networks,
just search for `hacdias` ðŸ˜ƒ.
