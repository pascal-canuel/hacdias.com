Hi, I'm Henrique Dias!

I'm a 17 years old Portuguese student passionated about programming and addicted to music and photography. I love the idea of improving the world using technology.

After that I want to study something. Right now, I don't really know what it should be. Maybe Computer Science, maybe Physics, maybe Biology. My objective is very simple: **do something helpful to the humankind**.

## Once upon a time...

When I was a child, my parents bought their first computer, a desktop, heavy one. I was like 4 or 5 years old if I remember correctly. That day, he mounted the computer and I was left with the boxes where everything have arrived. There was a box for the keyboard, a box for the screen and a box for the mouse. What have I done? I cut out the images of the gadgets and started "using" that computer. It was funny to play with a paper computer.

Unfortunately, I can't remember if my father allowed me to use it with that age. But I know that, sooner or later, he allowed me to use Microsoft Word. I was probably still very young because I didn't know how to write yet. How do I know that? I remember that I clicked randomly in the keys of the Keyboard to make something happen. I also remember that he was always telling me not to click on the funtion keys. He didn't know their function so we mustn't click on them.

Later, I have made something even funnier and interesting: my aunt has a mini marked so, she has a lot of paperboard boxes and stuff. I remember that I cut out a keyboard, a mouse and a monitor. But this time they hadn't pretty images! As I've already "played" with a computer, I already knew some things and I drew the keys, the buttons, the taskbar (of Windows XP) and even the icons in the desktop. I spent the whole morning o that day playing with that "computer".

## So...?

My interest for computers started when I was a little child. My father bought his first computer when I was 4 or 5 years old. I can't remember. Sometimes, my father simply opened Microsoft Word and I kept clicking randomly on the keys. I just clicked on numbers and letters of the alphabet because my father had told me to not click on the other keys. At that time I didn't know how to read and write yet. I just looked at the screen and clicked on the keys.

Over the years, my curiosity about computers has increased because I'm always exploring new things and functionalities that I didn't know that there were. Currently I'm improving my programming skills. Codecademy is one of the sites that I attend but there are others. Thanks, Codecademy!

In spite of liking a lot science related subjects, I want to become a programmer because all the reasons that I've talked about and many others. My favourite thing about programming is that we can make anything that we want with code. We can create, innovate, improve and have fun!  

I think that all the world should learn how to program because it is too much important in current days and it is a good form to have fun and practise our brain and estimulate our creativity.
