Hey!

I'm Henrique Dias, a Portuguese young boy which is currently attending at high school in a scientific-humanistic course called "Science and Technology" I hope to finish in 2017.

After that I want to study something. Right now, I don't really know what it should be. Maybe Computer Science, maybe Physics, maybe Biology. My objective is very simple: **do something helpful to the humankind**.

## Long version

My interest for computers started when I was a little child. My father bought his first computer when I was 4 or 5 years old. I can't remember. Sometimes, my father simply opened Microsoft Word and I kept clicking randomly on the keys. I just clicked on numbers and letters of the alphabet because my father had told me to not click on the other keys. At that time I didn't know how to read and write yet. I just looked at the screen and clicked on the keys.

Over the years, my curiosity about computers has increased because I’m always exploring new things and functionalities that I didn’t know that there were. Currently I’m improving my programming skills. Codecademy is one of the sites that I attend but there are others. Thanks, Codecademy!

In spite of liking a lot science related subjects, I want to become a programmer because all the reasons that I’ve talked about and many others. My favourite thing about programming is that we can make anything that we want with code. We can create, innovate, improve and have fun!  

I think that all the world should learn how to program because it is too much important in current days and it is a good form to have fun and practise our brain and estimulate our creativity.
