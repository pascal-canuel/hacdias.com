Since I was very young, I've always wanted to do something with computers. I didn't know why, but I knew that it would be related to what I wanted to do in future. Over the time, my interest in programming grew up a lot and I've been learning since I was 13 or 14â€¦ maybe? I can't recall correctly but that's not what matters. The present is what matters.

Here's a funny story about my childhood: when my father bought his first computer, he would open Word and let me write and click wherever I wanted except on the "F" keys. One day, his computer crashed during boot and he blamed me for that saying that I probably had clicked on those keys. Yes, really. And no, it's not that funny. 

Right now, I've some [open source projects](https://github.com/hacdias) - I absolutely defend the existence of open source - and I've been very lucky to get the opportunity to get some experience working on [other projects](/projects) with other people.

I've just finished secondary school and during my school years, I tried to participate as much as I could in many projects, such as *National Informatics Olympiads*, *Youth Parliament* and I've been secretary and vice-president of the Students' Union of my school for one year each position. This September, hopefully, I'll enroll a Computer Science degree in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon.

Have something to tell me? Just send an email to [hacdias@gmail.com](mailto:hacdias@gmail.com) or [tweet me](https://twitter.com/hacdias) and I'll be happy to talk to you ðŸ˜ƒ
