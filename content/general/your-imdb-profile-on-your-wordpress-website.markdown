A few months ago, [Luís Soares](http://luissoares.com/) and I created a [plugin for WordPress](/general/hackerrank-widget-for-wordpress/) entirely dedicated to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). The main functionality of that plugin is to show a mini version of your HackerRank profile on your website as a widget.

Now, we created a new one. Not for HackerRank, but for **IMDb**. Yes, you read correctly! For that amazing service which let us know more about (almost) any movie and serie. We called it IMDb Profile Widget!

All you have to do is to open our [plugin's page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/imdb-widget/), download it, upload it to your server and activate it (or you may want to install it directly through the interface). Then, go to widgets page and put the "IMDb Profile" wherever you want. To configure it you just have to put your IMDb id and check what you want to show. Yes, it's that simple!

**Features include:**

+ General information (like username, bio, badges...);
+ Ratings (with charts included);
+ Watchlist;
+ Other lists;
+ Reviews;
+ Board posts.

I have liked the development of this plugin but we need your help. Just you can say us if it's good, what's worst, what we have to improve. Your opinion is... **required**! Help us to build a better world.
