**[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)** is a competitive programming platform that started in 2012. It offers a lot of programming problems in different domains of [Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science).

Unfortunately, WordPress had no plugin to show a small version of my HackerRank profile. So [Luís Soares](http://luissoares.com/) and I have created a [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hackerrank-profile-widget/) which adds an HackerRank Widget to WordPress.

This plugin makes available a plugin that shows some information about a profile of HackerRank. Right now, the widget supports the following information:


  * Your **profile** information;
  * Your **badges**;
  * The **contests** you have enrolled;
  * The **challenges** you participated;
  * And your **discussions**;

It's very simple to use: just install, activate, put your username and check the itens you want to show.

You can install this plugin by searching "HackerRank Profile Widget" in your website WordPress dashboard or downloading it on its [page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hackerrank-profile-widget) and copying it to wp-content/plugins folder.

We hope you enjoy it!
