Upframe aims to become a global reference and authority in pre-acceleration, shaping the next generation of entrepreneurs by building an immersive experience, focused on young aspiring startup builders.

I've been working on Upframe as a **Full Stack Developer** and my experience has taught me some things, which I described in a [recent blog post](https://medium.com/@hacdias/how-to-work-remotely-in-a-startup-3e35c59f2d3e), such as: how to work in a team with a designer, develop myself, hear the opinion of the others, etc.
