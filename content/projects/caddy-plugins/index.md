[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) is a HTTP/2 web server with automatic HTTPS. It's easy to use, has no dependencies and it is already production-ready. One of the biggest advantagens of Caddy is that it is relatively simple to create plugins that extend its own native functionalities.

Despite having contributed few times to Caddy itself, I've managed to create some useful plugins for the community:

+ [**http.minify**](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.minify) implements minification on-the-fly for CSS, HTML, JSON, SVG and XML. It uses [tdewolff's minify library](https://github.com/tdewolff/minify).
+ [**http.webdav**](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.webdav) implements WebDAV capabilities with support for path restriction rules and users.
+ [**http.filemanager**](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.filemanager) is an implementation of my [File Manager project](/work/filemanager) as a plugin for Caddy.
+ [**http.hugo**](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.hugo) is a web interface for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static website generator.
+ [**hook.service**](https://caddyserver.com/docs/hook.service) implements of [github.com/kardianos/service](https://github.com/kardianos/service) to create services. Supports Windows XP+, Linux/(systemd | Upstart | SysV), and OSX/Launchd.
