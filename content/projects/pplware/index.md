Pplware is a portuguese project that delivers the most recent news about technology to everyone who speaks portuguese. It's also a place where you can ask for help in the forum or sending a mail. It also includes "Pplware Fórum"​, "Pplware Usados"​, "Comunidade Pplware@Linux"​ and "Pplware Kids".

I've mainly played a part in Pplware Kids, which is a blog directed to everyone. We want to deliver concise information that can be understood by everyone. We have "how to" tutorials, security tips for everyone. For kids, we give some tips to create good school works. For parents we have tutorials to protect their PC for the use of their children.
