      <description>I was there. I turn my head to the left and I see a bullet coming in my direction. The clock stops. I stop. I see myself doing nothing. I see my whole life running throughout my brain. I realize that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done what I should have done. My whole life was a wire, an intermittent wire which is going to eventually break up. I see my children, I see all of the people I love.</description>

      <description>Death. It&amp;rsquo;s the most heard word in the last days. Crime. And they say it was orders from their God. Who&amp;rsquo;s the God? Just someone telling them to kill, to suffocate the people until they die. Why are You doing this? Why is this God telling them to kill this people? Innocents. They didnt do anything. They were people. Just like you, just like me. They were in the wrong place.</description>
